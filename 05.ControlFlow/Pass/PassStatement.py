# pass is used to write: 
# 1. empty loops
# 2. empty control statement
# 3. function 
# 4. classes

# I guess, it will come handy when object oriented part comes along.

for letter in 'doremipa':
    pass # because of this it's an empty loop
print(letter) # but we get to print the last letter. Interesting!!!
