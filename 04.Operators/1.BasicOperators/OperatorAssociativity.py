# when operators with same precedence is used, it can either be 
# right to left or left to right

print(100/10*11) # apparently * and / have same precedence, so it gives 100
print(5-2+8) # + and - have same precedence.

# how i knew this calculation is, internally it happens like (100 * 11) / 10 or
# (5+8)-2

# but what the hell do i know!!!
